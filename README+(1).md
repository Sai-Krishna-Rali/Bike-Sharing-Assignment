# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

> - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
> - How well those variables describe the bike demands

> Our task involves creating a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes based on the available independent variables. This model will serve as a valuable tool for the management, offering insights into how demand fluctuates with various features. The information derived can guide strategic decisions, enabling the management to align business strategies with demand levels and meet customer expectations effectively. Additionally, the model will provide valuable insights into the demand dynamics of a new market, offering a comprehensive understanding for strategic planning.
