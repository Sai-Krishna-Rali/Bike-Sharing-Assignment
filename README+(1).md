# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

> - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
> - How well those variables describe the bike demands

> Our task involves creating a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes based on the available independent variables. This model will serve as a valuable tool for the management, offering insights into how demand fluctuates with various features. The information derived can guide strategic decisions, enabling the management to align business strategies with demand levels and meet customer expectations effectively. Additionally, the model will provide valuable insights into the demand dynamics of a new market, offering a comprehensive understanding for strategic planning.

## General Information
- The primary objective of this assignment is to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
- To achieve this,
	 - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
	 - How well those variables describe the bike demands
- We have been given a dataset that includes comprehensive information about weather, dates, seasons etc which helps in determining demand for shared bikes 
- Additionally, a data dictionary has been provided, offering descriptions and explanations for the attributes or variables present in the dataset.

## Conclusions
- The company can strategically enhance bike availability by aligning with specific weather and environmental conditions:
  	- During periods of elevated temperatures, there tends to be increased demand for bikes, possibly due to favorable weather conditions for outdoor activities
  	- Focusing on maintaining a larger fleet during clear weather allows the company to cater to the surge in demand and capitalize on optimal riding conditions.
  	- Lower windspeed is associated with more pleasant and comfortable biking experiences
  	- Bike rentals see a decrease during holidays, indicating heightened demand on working days, especially from commuters choosing bikes for transportation
  	- As there appears to be a yearly increase in demand, the company can strategically expand its bike inventory to capitalize on this growing demand.
